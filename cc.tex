\title{3x+1 Problem}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
  The Collatz Problem, also known as the \(3x+1\) problem, is defined as:
  \[
    c(x) = \left.
    \begin{cases}
        x/2, & \text{if } x = 0 {\pmod {2}}\\
        3x+1, & \text{if } x = 1 {\pmod {2}} \\
        \end{cases}
    \right\}, x \in \mathbb{N{^+}}
  \]
  Or the "shortcut" version:
  \[
    s(x) = \left.
    \begin{cases}
        x/2, & \text{if } x = 0 {\pmod {2}}\\
        (3x+1)/2, & \text{if } x = 1 {\pmod {2}} \\
        \end{cases}
    \right\}, x \in \mathbb{N{^+}}
  \]
  This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.
  \section{Proving odd inputs of Problem are even}
  The second part of the Collatz Conjecture (3x+1) applies to every number in the set: \(\{ x \in \mathbb{N{^+}} \ | \ 2x+1 \}\). \\
  Let c be a random number from this set. \(c(c) = 3(2x+1)+1 \) \\
  Factor out the variables: \(6x+3+1 = 6x+4 = 2(3x+2)\) \\
  Since the expression does not follow the form for an odd number, \(2x+1\), it is an even number.
  Therefore, all odd inputs of the Collatz Conjecture are even.
  \section{Proving the Collatz Problem for the set $2^{n}$}
  \(\{x \in \mathbb{N{^+}}: 2{^x}\}\) \\
  In this case, \(c^{(log_2{x})}(x) = 1\). \\
  Ex. \(x = 2, c(2) = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) \\
  Therefore, the conjecture for the set $2^{n}$ is true.
  \section{Finding functions $c{^2}(x)$ and beyond}
  Since $c(x)$ is a recursive function, we can repersent it as $c(c(x))$ or $c{^2}(x)$ and beyond.
  Let's start with the case of \(\{x \in \mathbb{N{^+}} \ | \ 2x+1\}\) \\
  \(c^2(x) = \frac{3x+1}{2}\) \\
  Using the proof discussed earlier, as odd inputs of \(c(x)\) always return a even value, we can deduce that \(c^2(x) = \frac{3x+1}{2}, x \in \mathbb{N{^+}} \ | \ 2x+1\).

  %$x * \prod\limits_{i=1}^{\log_2{x}} $
  %Let \(c\) be any number within \(\{\mathbb{N{^+}}\ | \ c = 0 \pmod {2} \}\). We put \(c\) into the \\ Collatz function \(c(c) = c/2 \). If \(c\) is even, then
  %We can duduce that the Collatz conjecture will lead to
